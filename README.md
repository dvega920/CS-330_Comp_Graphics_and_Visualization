## How do I approach designing software?
In terms of graphics rendering, I think the skills in this course taught me how to break down an image or design pattern into various shapes. I’ve never really designed with mathematics as a tool. Every line, every color, every event has some sort of mathematical logic baked into the code for it to work. I appreciate the reintroduction to mathematics as a tool for design.

The objects in my scene lacked color. All but one object was black. I tried to play with texturing a bit to give them more contrast. Even though they were the same color, the texture was different, which in real life made them look inherently unique. One was a shiny black metal, and the other was a matte black plastic. In addition to playing with texture, lighting was also a factor as the metal object would cast more of a reflection. 

I believe the skills I learned on this course could be applied to future work in website design. Although there are a ton of templates to work with in some CMS platforms, it is nice to be able to custom build graphics, and animations from scratch. I like to find ways to improve on something rather than try to reinvent the wheel. 

## How do I approach developing programs?
I wouldn’t call them new strategies but some I found to be very useful is iterative development and modularization. I could’ve been a bit more organized with my code by splitting it out into multiple .cpp files for readability. It was important to break up the project into smaller achievable tasks each week. As I learned a new skill, I implemented a new object that utilized those skills. Refinement of the object can be done later. My initial concern was to get the objects built, and then refine them. Modularization came in the form of functions and constructors. Setting constructors up saved a bunch of time when implementing a new object with different attributes. These functions made the code more flexible and reusable in different parts of my application.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computational graphics and visualizations can provide you with several benefits that can be applied in your future educational and professional pathways.

Visualizations can simplify complex concepts, making them easier to understand and remember.
Working with computational graphics often involves analyzing and interpreting data, which can help develop your data analysis skills.
Designing visualizations often requires creative problem-solving skills. This ability to think creatively and find innovative solutions is valuable in many fields.

Visualizations can help you learn how to effectively communicate complex ideas visually. 

Overall, computational graphics and visualizations can provide you with a range of skills and knowledge that are valuable in a variety of professional pathways. Having these skills makes you marketable and a valuable asset to organizations.
